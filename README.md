Name: Ryan Solomon

Course: Diploma in Software Development

Group: 1


Project Overview:

Project currently contain Website Proposal and HTML File structure.

Website Goals and Objectives:

The main objectives of the website are to raise donations and membership subscriptions, create awareness for wildlife conservation campaigns, and invite schools and businesses to join in and create sustainable initiatives. These are in line with best practices in online engagement, where usability and calls to action are important for boosting conversions (Interaction Design Foundation, 2024). The success of the website will be monitored using data from donations, sign-ups on campaigns, blog and newsletter subscribers, and the attendance of events.

Key Website Features and Functionality:

The suggested website would feature a simplified homepage with featured campaigns, a specific "Take Action" page with volunteer and donation possibilities, and an interactive map of South African conservation projects. A blog for news and successes, as well as a mobile-friendly donation process to facilitate donations for supporters (W3C, 2023b), would also be part of the website.

Project Timeline:

The project will follow the subject submission timeline. Part 1, which involves research and planning, is due on 27 August 2025 and will cover research and website proposals. Part 2, due on 26 September 2025, will involve designing the layout, wireframes, and website creation according to feedback. Part 3, due on 19 November 2025, will involve the complete development of the website, testing, optimisation, and final deployment.

Part 1 Details:

Project currently contain Website Proposal and HTML File structure.

Part 2 Details:

Added more to my html code and used css for better styling.

Changelog:

1) Added README file, Website Proposal, and html file structure.
2) Changed the layout of the website for easier development and to keep it looking simple but good (I will possibly change it again to be more advanced for part 3 with java script). Tested the website on multiple browsers. Added css to style my web pages, added more html code to work with the css, updated the README, added more references, added images to the website, added screenshots of different screen sizes.
3) Updates include fixing missing form fields, adding the full contact form, correcting HTML structure, and ensuring all inputs have proper attributes. Pages now use improved semantic layout, linked styling, and consistent navigation. Form readability, responsiveness, and accessibility were enhanced, and key bugs with missing tags and field IDs were resolved. Basic JavaScript validation and user feedback features were added or prepared for implementation.
Updated all file, and added robots.txt and sitemap.xml.

Tools Used:

Smartdraw for diagrams, Microsoft Word for text, Visual Studio for code.
