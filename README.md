Project Overview:

Project currently contain Website Proposal and HTML File structure.

Website Goals and Objectives:

The main objectives of the website are to raise donations and membership subscriptions, create awareness for wildlife conservation campaigns, and invite schools and businesses to join in and create sustainable initiatives. These are in line with best practices in online engagement, where usability and calls to action are important for boosting conversions (Interaction Design Foundation, 2024). The success of the website will be monitored using data from donations, sign-ups on campaigns, blog and newsletter subscribers, and the attendance of events.

Key Website Features and Functionality:

The suggested website would feature a simplified homepage with featured campaigns, a specific "Take Action" page with volunteer and donation possibilities, and an interactive map of South African conservation projects. A blog for news and successes, as well as a mobile-friendly donation process to facilitate donations for supporters (W3C, 2023b), would also be part of the website.

Project Timeline:

The project will follow the subject submission timeline. Part 1, which involves research and planning, is due on 27 August 2025 and will cover research and website proposals. Part 2, due on 26 September 2025, will involve designing the layout, wireframes, and website creation according to feedback. Part 3, due in October 2025, will involve the complete development of the website, testing, optimisation, and final deployment.
